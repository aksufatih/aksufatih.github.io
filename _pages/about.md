Hello! I am a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cosbi-lab/">Research Unit of Computer Systems and Bioinformatics</a> at <a href="https://www.unicampus.it/en/">Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma</a>, specializing in multimodal deep learning with a focus on medical imaging. My research aims to develop advanced diagnostic tools for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). I have also contributed to resilient AI research, focusing on triplet networks and federated learning approaches to enhance robustness in medical AI systems.

I hold a bachelor's and master's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://ncc.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University Northern Cyprus Campus</a>. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cosbi-lab.it/paolo-soda/">Paolo Soda</a> and <a href="https://unisr.unifind.cineca.it/get/person/chiti-arturo">Arturo Chiti</a> at Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma.

Feel free to reach out to discuss collaborations or share ideas about AI-driven healthcare innovation!
